            <p>
              I am not an art person. 
              The last time I took art class formally was in secondary school where I got C and came 5 points from failing. 
              However, in term 3 of my undergraduate studies, I decided to try a module offered by my university’s architecture pillar. 
              Of the 4 electives offered that term, Spatial Design World (SDW) was easily the module I had the least experience going into. 
              But it was also the only module I felt could not be self-studied (Design is hard to learn without feedback). 
              Thus, against my better judgement, I took it as one of my two electives for the term.
            </p>
            <p>
              SDW was primarily about architectural representations of space. 
              The module consisted of 4 projects spread out over the term, with each project (except exercise 4) introducing ways to represent space. 
              We then used each technique to do our assignments using the Rhino CAD tool. 
              The remainder of this page is a showcase of my (alright) work (at least, I think it was alright).
            </p>
            <h1>Exercise 1 - Floorplans and Bad Time Management</h1>
            <div class="inner-divider"></div>
            <p>
              The first exercise was about floorplans. 
              The lessons focused on architectural conventions for drawing floorplans, details, and line weights with our assignment being to draw our rooms and create a gif featuring the room floorplan.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, most of my time was instead spent wrangling with Rhino since I had virtually no experience using it (or any CAD program) before our first class. 
              By the end of 4 weeks, I did finish my floorplan:
            </p>
            <!-- room.pdf goes here -->
            <center><img class="media" src="../assets/project-1/room.jpg"></center>

            <p>
              My biggest struggle for the first exercise was the gif. 
              I had an idea for the gif that I wanted to see through. 
              However, my idea required hand drawing almost every frame of a 15 second animation, which I also had no experience in. 
              I could (and probably should) have done something simpler to animate. 
              However, I stuck to my idea and burnt almost 3 whole days working on it:

            <p>
              And I'm pretty happy I did.
            </p>
            <h1>Exercise 2 - Projections and Not Having Recess Week</h1>
            <div class="inner-divider"></div>
            <p>
              The second exercise was about drawing projection views (isometric, axonometric, military, etc.). 
              The task was to draw isometric projections of our block and room, and axonometric projections of any 3 items in our room. 
              Most classes focused on 3D modelling items in Rhino which was fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was not easy to get measurements for my house. 
              At first, I tried to use measuring tape and string to get rough approximations of lengths and heights. 
              However, I eventually just eyeballed most measurements and hoped everything worked out (they were grading style, not accuracy). 
              I also felt modelling an entire electronic drum kit would take more time than I realistically had for the exercise, so I decided to do some room redecorating.

            <p>
              Since I had exams the week before recess week, and the project was due after the break, I spent majority of said recess week on the project. 
              I also was proud of my first gif and wanted to try my hand at another similar one.

            <h1>Exercise 3 - Point Clouds and Something Completely Different</h1>
            <div class="inner-divider"></div>
            <p>
              Exercise 3 was about 3D scanning technology. 
              The assignment was very different from the first two in having multiple parts and being pair work. 
              The project involved getting a 3D scan of us and utilising the resulting point cloud to (1) make and print a 3D model of ourselves, (2) create an avatar of ourselves using the point cloud, and (3) make a video using the scan alongside a scan of an area.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did the project along with a friend from class. 
              The first 2 parts of the submission did not take particularly long to do. 
              We used the Luma AI application for iOS to do our scans and generate point clouds. 
              A few hours doing Grasshopper scripting in Rhino gave me my avatar:

            <h1>Exercise 4 - All Hail LeeGPT</h1>
            <div class="inner-divider"></div>
            <p>
              Exercise 4 is hard to explain. 
              The basic premise of the exercise is to leverage AI technology to assist in creating designs. 
              What that meant in practice was confused since the assignment had 8 deliverables. 
              Fortunately, it was a group project which means instead of me being confused alone, I had 4 other people to be confused with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project started by choosing a designer item from a list of 41 and researching it. 
              We had to write up a report on the item's history, designer's intent, and cultural context. 
              The list mostly contained furniture but some other odd items including suits, dresses, and coffee machines. 
              My group went with <a href="https://willrootdesign.com/exo-prosthetic-leg" target="_blank">this</a> prosthetic leg by William Root.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, we had to consider future changes to the item's design caused by whatever factors we could think of: 
              future cultural movements, advances in technology, changing design principles, etc. 
              We then had to plug our ideas into the Stable Diffusion model to generate prototype images, from which we would have to physically prototype our “leg of the future”.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not sure most of us really 'got' the project. 
              On the one hand, I understand leveraging AI technology to do tasks. 
              On the other, the way it was intended to be used for this project was not entirely clear. 
              However, we pushed on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since I did not have a computer powerful enough to run Stable Diffusion, and my brother was out of the country, I borrowed his PC to run a Stable Diffusion server for my group. 
              We went though a lot of sketches trying to get a design we liked.

            <p>
              We started doing 3D modelling for our prototype at about the same time. 
              One of my friends, a genius in Grasshopper scripting, automated most of the build process to get us a skeletal frame for our prosthetic leg.
              However, after the trauma that was exercise 2, he did not want to do the technical drawings, so I took his models to do the drawings for the group.
